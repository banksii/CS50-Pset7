Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science 2012 - Problem Set 7

A Fantasy Formula 1 game created for my final project.  Users can select their own F1 line up and follow their progress as the real F1 season progresses.  You can compete in your own private leagues and users can manage their teams throughout the season - though changes will cost you points!  

Its built using PHP, mySQL and javascript.  I used ergast.com's motor racing API to get race results, race schedules and team and driver line-ups, so administration of the site is very minimal.  At the moment I just need to click a button after each race to update all the users results, but I'm sure the button clicking can be automated in the future too!
